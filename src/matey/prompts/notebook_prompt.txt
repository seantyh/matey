These notebooks may contain sections on Data dependencies, which declare the input data,
 and Export Artefacts, which declare the output data. You need to list these sections separately, 
 including the file paths and their sha1 hashes. For R notebooks, Input data may be the file sha1sums listed 
 at the beginning of the notebook; Export Artefacts are the file sha1sums calculated for the output files 
 at the end of the notebook.
